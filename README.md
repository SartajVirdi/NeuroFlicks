This repository documents my hands-on journey building a content-based movie recommender system using deep learning. Based on the Coursera specialization, I reimplemented each core component â€” from feature preprocessing and neural network modeling to user/movie embedding generation and distance-based recommendations.

The model learns user preferences based on genre-level behavior and movie metadata, and recommends similar films using learned feature vectors. Each step is broken down for learning and reproducibility.
